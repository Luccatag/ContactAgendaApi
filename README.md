# Contact Agenda Project

## ðŸ“„ Challenge Description (Translated)

You are to develop a CRUD application for a contact agenda (name, email, and phone) using .NET 6 or higher for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend.

**Requirements:**
- Business rules and validations (you define the rules)
- Use of design patterns (repositories, services, controllers, interfaces, dependency injection, etc.)
- Use of Entity Framework
- Use of accessory libraries/frameworks (e.g., Dapper, AutoMapper, FluentValidation)
- Use of Swagger
- Clean and organized code
- Backend test coverage
- Strong use of components in the frontend

**Differentials:**
- Use of CQRS design pattern
- Authentication/Security in the backend
- Messaging with RabbitMQ
- Frontend test coverage
- Application Dockerfile

The project itself is simple, but you are encouraged to enhance it to best showcase your skills as a developer. You may use any type of database.

## âœ… Completed Steps
- .NET 6+ backend project initialized (ContactAgendaApi)
- Vue 3 frontend project initialized (contact-agenda-frontend)
- Solution structured with Models, DTOs, Repositories, Services, Controllers, Interfaces
- EF Core set up with AppDbContext and SQLite database
- Contact model scaffolded (Name, Email, Phone)
- API routes (CRUD) planned and implemented
- EntityFramework, AutoMapper, FluentValidation, Swashbuckle/Swagger configured
- PrimeVue, axios, vue-router, pinia installed in frontend
- Frontend refactored to use modular, reusable components (ContactList, ContactItem, ContactForm)
- Responsive grid layout for contacts implemented
- Frontend CRUD (add, edit, view, delete) fully integrated and connected to backend (JSON persistence)
- Navigation between pages using vue-router
- Backend CRUD supports both real database (EF Core) and JSON file persistence (via repository pattern)
- Swagger UI tested and working for all CRUD endpoints
- FluentValidation integrated and enforced in controller actions
- Dapper integration implemented and testable via dedicated controller
- Backend and frontend services (CRUD, validation, mapping, navigation) are working and tested
- Code organized and follows clean architecture principles

## ðŸš§ Next Steps
1. **Add unit/integration tests for backend**
   - Create a test project and add tests for Service, Repository (including JSON persistence), and Dapper endpoints.
2. **Refactor frontend to use component-based structure**
   - Modularize UI and views for maintainability and scalability.
   - Recommended additional components:
     - AppHeader (navigation bar)
     - AppFooter (footer)
     - Login/Register forms (authentication)
     - Notification/Alert (success/error messages)
     - Modal/Dialog (confirmation dialogs)
     - Loader/Spinner (loading states)
     - Pagination (for large contact lists)
     - UserProfile (user info)
     - Layout (main wrapper for consistent page structure)
3. **Switch all frontend API calls to axios**
   - Replace fetch with axios in Vue components for consistency and better error handling.
4. **Implement Pinia for state management (optional)**
   - Use Pinia to manage contacts state in frontend.
5. **Add frontend test coverage**
   - Add unit and integration tests for Vue components.
6. **Implement secure login and user-specific encrypted contacts**
   - Add user registration and login endpoints (JWT or ASP.NET Core Identity)
   - Store passwords securely (hashed and salted)
   - Add UserId to Contact model and scope all CRUD to authenticated user
   - Encrypt contact data before storing in the database (AES or similar)
   - Add login/register pages to frontend and send JWT with API requests
7. **Bonus: Implement CQRS, RabbitMQ, Dockerfile**
   - Add advanced features as needed to demonstrate differentials.
