4. **Expand frontend to full CRUD**
   - Implement update and delete in Vue view.
5. **Refactor frontend to use component-based structure**
   - Modularize UI and use vue-router for navigation.
6. **Use axios for all API calls in frontend**
   - Replace fetch with axios in Vue components.
7. **Implement Pinia for state management (optional)**
   - Use Pinia to manage contacts state in frontend.
8. **Add frontend test coverage**
   - Add unit and integration tests for Vue components.
9. **Bonus: Implement CQRS, authentication/security, RabbitMQ, Dockerfile**
   - Add advanced features as needed.
