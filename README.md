# Contact Agenda Project

## üìÑ Challenge Description (Translated)

You are to develop a CRUD application for a contact agenda (name, email, and phone) using .NET 6 or higher for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend.

**Requirements:**
- Business rules and validations (you define the rules)
- Use of design patterns (repositories, services, controllers, interfaces, dependency injection, etc.)
- Use of Entity Framework
- Use of accessory libraries/frameworks (e.g., Dapper, AutoMapper, FluentValidation)
- Use of Swagger
- Clean and organized code
- Backend test coverage
- Strong use of components in the frontend

**Differentials:**
- Use of CQRS design pattern
- Authentication/Security in the backend
- Messaging with RabbitMQ
- Frontend test coverage
- Application Dockerfile

The project itself is simple, but you are encouraged to enhance it to best showcase your skills as a developer. You may use any type of database.

   - ~~Modularize UI and views for maintainability.~~
3. ~~**Use axios for all API calls in frontend**~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
   - ~~Replace fetch with axios in Vue components for consistency and better error handling.~~
4. ~~**Implement Pinia for state management (optional)**~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
   - ~~Use Pinia to manage contacts state in frontend.~~
5. **Add frontend test coverage**
   - Add unit and integration tests for Vue components.
6. **Bonus: Implement CQRS, authentication/security, RabbitMQ, Dockerfile**
   - Add advanced features as needed to demonstrate differentials.

## üîß Technical Notes
### API Endpoints
- **`/api/contacts`**: Main CRUD endpoints using JSON file persistence (`contacts.json`) - temporary database substitute
  - `GET /api/contacts` - Retrieve all contacts
  - `GET /api/contacts/{id}` - Retrieve specific contact
  - `POST /api/contacts` - Create new contact
  - `PUT /api/contacts/{id}` - Update existing contact
  - `DELETE /api/contacts/{id}` - Delete contact
  - `PATCH /api/contacts/{id}/favorite` - Toggle favorite status
- **`/api/contactagenda`**: Demo endpoints using in-memory storage
- **`/api/dappercontacts`**: Sample Dapper integration endpoint

### Database Strategy
- **Current**: JSON file (`contacts.json`) serves as temporary database for development/demonstration
- **Production Ready**: EF Core with SQLite database configured and available
- **Repository Pattern**: Allows easy switching between storage implementations
- **Schema**: Contact model includes Id, Name, Email, Phone, and IsFavorite fields

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component Structure**: Organized into `layout/` and `ui/` folders
- **State Management**: Pinia store with centralized contact data, optimistic updates, and intelligent caching
- **API Layer**: Axios-based service layer with centralized error handling
- **Responsive Design**: CSS Grid with automatic column adjustment based on screen width
- **Validation**: Client-side regex validation with server-side FluentValidation backup
- **Search Functionality**: Real-time contact filtering across name, email, and phone fields
- **Favorite System**: Interactive heart buttons with visual feedback and automatic list sorting

## üîÑ How to Switch from JSON to SQLite Database

Currently, the application uses a JSON file (`contacts.json`) as a temporary database substitute. To switch to the production-ready SQLite database:

### **Step 1: Update Dependency Injection in Program.cs**
Navigate to `Program.cs` and replace the JSON repository registration:

**Current (JSON):**
```csharp
// Register JsonContactRepository for DI (all contact CRUD will use contacts.json)
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IContactRepository>(provider =>
    new JsonContactRepository("contacts.json")
);
```

**Change to (SQLite):**
```csharp
// Register ContactRepository for DI (all contact CRUD will use SQLite database)
builder.Services.AddScoped<IContactRepository, ContactRepository>();
```

### **Step 2: Run Database Migrations**
Execute the following commands in the project root directory:
```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

### **Step 3: Verify Database Creation**
- The SQLite database file `ContactAgenda.db` will be created in the project root
- You can inspect it using SQLite browser tools or Visual Studio

### **Step 4: Optional - Seed Initial Data**
If you want to transfer existing JSON data to SQLite:
1. Copy contacts from `contacts.json`
2. Use the `/api/contacts` POST endpoint to add them to the database
3. Or create a data seeding method in `Program.cs`

### **Benefits of SQLite vs JSON:**
- **Performance**: Better query performance and indexing
- **Concurrency**: Better handling of simultaneous requests
- **Relationships**: Support for foreign keys and complex queries
- **Transactions**: ACID compliance for data integrity
- **Scalability**: Can handle larger datasets efficiently

### **Switching Back to JSON:**
Simply reverse Step 1 to return to JSON file persistence for development/testing purposes.

## ‚≠ê Favorite Contacts Feature

The application includes a comprehensive favorite contacts system that allows users to mark important contacts and access them quickly.

### **How It Works:**
- **Heart Button**: Each contact card displays a heart button (ü§ç for non-favorites, ‚ù§Ô∏è for favorites)
- **Toggle Functionality**: Click the heart to instantly toggle favorite status with visual feedback
- **Smart Sorting**: Favorite contacts automatically appear at the top of the list
- **Persistent State**: Favorite status is saved and maintained across sessions
- **Form Integration**: New contacts can be marked as favorites during creation
- **Edit Support**: Favorite status can be changed when editing existing contacts

### **Technical Implementation:**
- **Backend**: New `IsFavorite` boolean field added to Contact model and database
- **API Endpoint**: `PATCH /api/contacts/{id}/favorite` for toggling favorite status
- **Frontend**: Pinia store handles optimistic updates with automatic error recovery
- **UI/UX**: Smooth animations and immediate visual feedback for user interactions
- **Data Migration**: Existing contacts automatically receive `IsFavorite: false` as default

### **Database Schema Update:**
```sql
-- Migration: AddIsFavoriteToContact
ALTER TABLE Contacts ADD COLUMN IsFavorite BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
```

### **User Experience:**
1. **Visual Distinction**: Favorite contacts show filled heart (‚ù§Ô∏è) and appear at top of list
2. **Quick Access**: Most important contacts are always visible first
3. **Intuitive Interface**: Familiar heart icon pattern for favoriting
4. **Instant Feedback**: Optimistic updates make the interface feel responsive
5. **Error Handling**: If toggle fails, UI automatically reverts with error message
